# Braces2TeethUtilities
 
This repo has 4 utility modules that help me to deal with some problems in braces2teeth model.

- crawl: python script uses selenium to crawl images on https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/

- counterWithFile: it's has a lot of functions: resize the image, convert type, center image, change all file's name in a specific folder.

- evaluateData: it's helped me calculate the metrics automatically or plot visual charts/graphs.

- facial: includes complicated functions which use for creating Pix2Pix's dataset.
